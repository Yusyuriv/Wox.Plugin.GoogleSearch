### Temporarily removed from Plugin Store
This plugin is no longer working, see https://github.com/jjw24/Wox.Plugin.GoogleSearch/issues/5. Due to other priorities I can not guarantee a time to investigate and fix this plugin.

Please feel free to jump in and help.

This is a port of the Wox plugin [GoogleSearch](https://github.com/mikemorain/Wox.Plugin.GoogleSearch)(Google Search Plus) created by Mike Morain (@mikemorain).

This port is intended to be used for [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher). It will not work for Wox.

To download this plugin, go to the latest [release](https://github.com/jjw24/Wox.Plugin.GoogleSearch/releases/latest) and extract the zip file to Flow's user data plugin directory.

Changes contained in this port:

- Upgraded to .Net 5
- Changed Wox's plugin library to Flow's plugin library
